# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    system = StudentManagementSystem()
    system.run()

##  Changes Made
1. Code Organization and Separation of Concerns
Version 1:
The Student class is responsible for student data and some behavior (like updating).
The StudentDatabase class handles storage and manipulation of students.
The StudentManagementSystem class manages user interactions with the system.
Version 2:
Introduces the StudentInfo class, which is responsible for displaying student information. This separates the display logic from the Student class, which now only holds data.
This separation of concerns enhances code clarity and maintainability.
2. Input Validation and User Interaction
Version 1:
There is no built-in input validation or user interaction beyond basic method calls and print statements.
Version 2:
Introduces get_validated_input for user input validation. This function handles various data types and ensures inputs are correct before proceeding.
Adds a display_menu method and a run method to manage user interaction via a command-line menu, making the system more user-friendly and interactive.
3. Error Handling and Feedback
Version 1:
Basic functionality without explicit user feedback on operations like adding, updating, or removing students.
Version 2:
Provides feedback messages for actions such as adding, removing, and updating students. This improves user experience by giving clear indications of the success or failure of their actions.
Handles cases where students are not found for removal or updating, informing the user appropriately.
4. Student Update Logic
Version 1:
The update_student method in the Student class updates student attributes based on provided parameters, but does not provide feedback on success or failure.
Version 2:
The update_student_info method in StudentManagementSystem includes checks for None values and provides feedback if a student is updated or not found, which makes the update process more robust and user-friendly.
5. Functionality Extensions
Version 1:
Basic functionality for adding, removing, updating, and displaying students.
Version 2:
Extends functionality with the ability to handle empty inputs during updates, thus offering more flexibility and user control.
6. Code Robustness and Maintainability
Version 1:
Straightforward and functional but less modular and flexible.
Version 2:
Modularized into distinct classes and methods, improving maintainability and scalability. Adding new features or modifying existing ones becomes easier due to the separation of concerns.
7. Feedback Messages
Version 1:
Does not include feedback messages for user actions.
Version 2:
Includes informative messages for various actions (e.g., student added, removed, updated), which helps in tracking the systemâ€™s state and improves the user experience.
8. Code Execution Entry Point
Version 1:
Executes commands through direct method calls.
Version 2:
Uses a run method with a command-line interface for better interaction, making it more suitable for real-world usage and testing.
